<h2 id="management-and-development">Project Management and Development Approach</h2>

This project was implemented using the Agile Manifesto methodology. Below are the ways this project adhered to the 4 core values and 12 core principles of the Agile Methodolgy:

<strong>Four Values of the Agile Manifesto:</strong>

- Vision 1: Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: **Extensive research was carried on recipes that had popular demand** The Team held [**frequent meetings were held everyday to ensure we were meeting our objects and on target for completion** planning sessions via **Slack, Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams**, ensuring alignment with customer needs and prioritizing features through user story mapping.
- **a screenshot or graphic representation of a Zoom meeting with team members.**

- Vision 2: Responding to change over following a plan: **[Initially the Gallery page was intended to be structured in a mosaic arrangement of the images however this was not working correctly. We decided to change the design to a card system]**: Throughout the project, the team managed (
  [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-closed/github-username/name-of-repository?)](https://github.com/github-username/name-of-repository/issues) + [![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/github-username/name-of-repository?)](https://github.com/github-username/name-of-repository/issues) ) GitHub issues, adapting to changing requirements and feedback iteratively.
  **A screenshot of the GitHub project board demonstrates their flexibility.**

- Vision 3: Working software over comprehensive documentation: **[Sample description]** Achieved **[number of story points]** across **[number of sprints]**, emphasizing the focus on delivering functional software increments.
- **A snapshot of the scrum/kanban board tracks their progress.**

- Vision 4: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  Description: Daily interactions on GitHub led to **[number of commits]**, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members.
- **A snapshot of GitHub issue discussions illustrates their collaborative environment.**

<strong>Twelve Principles of the Agile Manifesto</strong>

- Face-to-face conversation: Utilized **in-person and/or virtual meetings (select one or all the options)** to enhance clarity and understanding.
- Motivated individuals: Empowered team members through skill development and recognition.
- Measure progress through working product: Evaluated progress based on delivered functionality in each sprint.
- Promote sustainable development: Prioritized sustainability practices to ensure long-term success.
- Simplicity is essential: Used MoSCoW prioritization and focused on MVP delivery to avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence: Adopted show and tell technique to ensure all team members learn while collaborating.

<h2 id="bugs-and-issues">Bugs and Issues</h2>

<p>
- Index page:
Footer not going full width and covering the content on the index page. Fixed by adjusting padding and margins
Images from the carousel not lining up when images switch. Fixed using Canva to adjust images to the same pixel size
Header covering carousel in phone size. Fixed by media query adjusting padding for certain screen sizes.
Carousel icons dropping down the page well below the image. Fixed by placing the carousel in a separate div to the text section below it.
Recipe page:
Tried to create a second row to nav bar but on large screens the buttons would just appear on the normal navbar at the right side. Tried adding containers rows and columns, which failed. Fixed by creating a full width div with buttons matching the navbar and fixing it to the bottom of the nav bar but outside of the nav section. And giving it a z-index higher than the main page content but lower than the nav so that when the dropdown comes down it covers the page nav buttons.
Footer not going full width and covering the content on the index page. Fixed by adjusting padding and margins
Gallery page:
Yaz’s code which worked on VS code didn’t work when added to the gitpod, so he had to adjust his code.
Yaz’s branch refused to merge with main so merged via Charlie’s branch
